AribaWeb README file, November 2008

INTRODUCTION

AribaWeb is a component-oriented framework for building web application
user interfaces.  The AW distribution includes both the (relatively) low-level
core rendering and request handling framework (ariba.aribaweb) as well
as a higher level library of ui components (ariba.widgets, ariba.metaui, ...)


INTENDED AUDIENCE
    Presently documentation and tutorials are limited.  This situation will be
    remedied soon.  Until then, make sure to check out the online tutorials
    (search vimeo.com for "aribaweb") and step through the bundled examples.

Version 5.0b6 (BETA)
    Although most of the libraries in this distribution has been incorporated in a
    variety of Ariba commercial application releases over as many as 9 years, this
    is its first release in OpenSource form and there are, therefore, likely issues
    that will arise from its use in non-Ariba contexts.  Also, the documentation
    is not ready for release and the metaui (and especially metaui-jpa) layers
    are new.  As such, we're calling it beta for the time being...  (That said, the
    majority of aribaweb and widgets APIs are likely to be very stable from here foreward)
