New in Version 5.0RC3 - PREVIEW 3 (4/8/2009)
---------------------------------------------
- Formatter enhancements
    - AWVFormatterFactory has new FormatterProvider interface where external providers can
      register handlers to add/override formatters in the default $formatters set
	- Multi-currency formatter support
	    - New GenericMoneyFormatter: formatter with interfaces to be adapted to various Money/Currency implementations (via class extensions)
        - New BigDecimalMoneyFormatter: based on GenericMoneyFormatter, provides currency formatting of BigDecimals based on formatter-specified currency
	    - New $formatter.currency and $formatters.currencyLong formatter maps.
	      E.g. can use $formatters.currency.EUR to get a formatter with a euro symbol prefix,
	      or $formatters.currencyLong.EUR to get one that will prefix with the Euro symbol and suffix with "EUR".
	    - $formatters.money now returns a BigDecimalMoneyFormatter from the $formatters.currency set, based on the AWVFormatterFactory.getDefaultCurrencyName().
	      Apps may override the application-wide default currency by calling AWVFormatterFactory.getDefaultCurrencyName("GBP") from their application init() method.
	    - AWTCSVDataSource now parses decimal numbers as BigDecimals instead of as Doubles

    - MetaUI string externalization support
        - Support for $[] localized string contants in .oss files
        - Support for externalization of auto-generated labels (e.g. string file lookup is
          performed for class, module and layout labels that would otherwise be defaulted
          based on "decamelized" version of name)

        (before they are actaully translated)

    - Support for rendering Search Form outside of result table header
        - Module trait "SearchInToc" to put search form in TOC (with narrow labelsOnTop rendering)
        - Refactored MetaSearch and MetaDetailTable to create MetaTable -- more meta-controllable table setup

- IE8 support

      2) top-level nav actions

- Build system improvements
    - Faster builds and smaller wars: strip unneeded Xinha files from ariba.widgets.jar
    - Fix resource packaging error when rebuilding from clean on Windows (was resulting in exceptions about
      "bad date format", etc, due to missing resources).
    - ariba.src-all.jar should include metaui-jpa and awreload source
    - Fix 'war' target not forcing build of app jar
