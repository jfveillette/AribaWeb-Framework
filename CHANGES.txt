    - New w:Markdown tag for writing markdown in components

- Reworked organization of Examples

    - No embedded (demoshell) JS and groovy -- all .java or discrete .groovy files

- Improved Component Inspector
    - Browse metaui meta data (properties, and assignment source)
    - Cleaner switching between path and tree views

- Added RichTextEditor widget (based on Xinha javascript library)
    - Used automatically by Meta UI for strings marked with trait "RichText"

  EJB3 JPA / Hibernate.  Includes project templates, ant files, and bundled HSQLDB

- Demo app enhancements
    - Separate demo app from demoshell lib
    - Support for .groovy files (in addition to script embedded in <groovy> tags) with automatic reloading

- New "start", "aw" and "create-project" commands
    - "aw" command sets up AW_HOME, ANT_HOME, JAVA_HOME, and checks CATALINA_HOME
        - will invoke ant targets from tools/build-commands.xml (like create-project)

        - currently have templates for a basic AW/Widgets apps and MetaUI-jpa (database) apps

      web.xml and aribaweb.properties generated automatically
    - Can build and run tomcat directly from app subdirectory (if AW_HOME set)
    - Tomcat 6 support (copy conf from CATALINA_HOME rather than bundle it)

- Embedded Tomcat (6.0.x) and Ant (1.7.1) simplifies getting started

- Lib dir re-org
    - External dependencies now in ext* subdirectories of lib
    - Example ariba libs now prefixed with "app." (to distinguish from ariba.*.jar libs)


New in Version 0.8.2 (6/25/2008)
---------------------------------
- Ant build file cleanup
    - Top level ant file!
    - Much faster incremental builds (no rebuilding jars/wars that didn't change)
    - Just type "ant" to build and run
    - Non-library apps can build without AW source (just need jars)
    - Apps automatically launched with rapid turnaround set up (ARIBA_AW_SEARCH_PATH set)

- Source tree simplification
    - Examples moved to top level examples directory
    - Demoshell examples moved to examples/demoshell-site (out of the demoshell src)

- MetaUI greatly enhanced
    - Big performance and correctness enhancements
    - Support for complex nested layouts (tabs, sections, to-many property display)
    - Persistence package -- foundation for JPA/Hibernate (or other ORM) integration
    - App nav tabs now track current page (regardless of how user got there)
    - More MetaUI examples (BusObjUI now has Simple, Medium, and Advanced examples)
    - Exceptions post rapid-turnaround edits (especially with .oss files) eliminated

    - Nicer exception page (and proper UI rendering of exceptions occuring on first request)
    - AWLocalLoginSessionHander -- clean support for actions that require authentication
        before proceeding (see initSessionValidator() in demoshell/.../Application.java
        and secureAction in examples/demoshell-site/TnE/ERPage.htm)
