KNOWN ISSUES AND PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS

(You don't need to report the following...)

Planned Enhancements:

    - Need documentation
        - Conceptual overview
        - Tutorials
        - JavaDoc (for key classes) and AW tag reference sheets

    - Better Samples (example apps)
        - Focussed examples of use for all key AWComponents
        - Well commented examples for more complex scenarios

    - AWReload (java class reloading) support

Your Help Requested:

    (Would be great if someone chipped in on the following...)

    - Running nicely in Eclipse and IDEA (build/run without ANT)

    - Running in app servers other than Tomcat (just need nice Ant rules...)

    - Maven?!?
