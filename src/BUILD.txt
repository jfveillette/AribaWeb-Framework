AribaWeb Build Instructions

$Id: $

Basic steps:
  0) Install pre-requisites and set up your environment variables

  1) Download AribaWeb and unpack it

  2) CD to "src" subdirectory of AW installation
        i.e. cd <aw dir>/src

  3) Run ant

  4) Run test apps (via tomcat)

  5) Experiment with making changes!

Step 0) Install pre-requisites and set up your environment variables

    - Install the Java5 or Java6 JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)
        - set your JAVA_HOME

    - Install Ant v1.7+ (http://ant.apache.org/)
        - set your ANT_HOME environment variable to your Ant install directory

        I.e.:
            export JAVA_HOME='d:/jdk1.5'
            export ANT_HOME="d:/ant"
            export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin;$ANT_HOME/bin;$PATH"

Like many java projects, AW uses Apache Ant for build
automation.  Note: you MUST use Ant version 1.7 or greater.


Step 1) Download AribaWeb

Download either a zip or a tarred/gzipped version of the archive, and
uncompress it into a directory of your choice.

Step 2) CD to "src" subdirectory of AW installation

AW's src directory contains the build.xml file. By default,
you do not need to change any of the settings in this file, but you do
need to run ant from this location so it knows where to find build.xml.

If you would like to change settings you can do so by creating one 
or more of the following files and placing your own property settings
in there:

    ~/aribaweb.build.properties
    ~/build.properties
    aribaweb-x.y/build.properties

The first property which is found in the order with which the files are
loaded becomes the property setting which is used by the Ant build
system.

NOTE: the ~ character represents your user account home directory.

Step 3) Run ant

Assuming you have ant in your PATH and have set ANT_HOME to the
location of your ant installation, typing "ant" at the shell prompt
and command prompt should run ant.  Ant will by default look for the
"build.xml" file in your current directory, and invoke the "jars" target.

Some useful targets include:
    - jar
        Compile AW, create jars in lib/ directory
    - wars
        jars + create demo wars in the webapps/ directory
    - tomcat
        invoke tomcat using the AW top-level dir as the CATALINA_BASE
        (and setting ARIBA_DEMOSHELL_HOME to ./src/demoshell/site)
    - tomcat-build
        build wars, then run tomcat

Step 4) Run (via tomcat)
    - Install Apache Tomcat 5.5 Core (http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi)
        - set your CATALINA_HOME environment variable to your tomcat install directory
            I.e.:
                export CATALINA_HOME="d:/tomcat5.5"

    - Run "ant tomcat"

    - Once the apps are running, try to click on the "AW Options" link at the
      top center of the window and select "Show Component Inspector".  A window will open
      (if you instruct your browser popup blocker to allow it) showing the hierarchical
      component structure of whatever page you are on in the other window.  As you click
      in the main window, this "Inspector" will update.  Now, click on one of the rows
      in the inspector table and you will be able to see the .awl template for that
      part of the page.  This is an excellent way to browse the code behind the examples.

      TO DEBUG:
      Set the following variables in your environment:
	        export JPDA_ADDRESS=8000
        	export JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket
      Then you can attach from your IDE.

Step 5)Experiment with making changes!
    - The code in demoshell/site is automatically enabled for "rapid turnaround" -- i.e.
      you can edit a .htm file, click refresh (F5) on your browser, and immediately see
      the change take effect.

    - For other AW code (or samples) to get rapid-turnaround you need to tell AW where,
      to find your source directories (to it looks at those copies of the files instead
      of the resources compiled into your jars).  Just set the ARIBA_AW_SEARCH_PATH as follows:

        export ARIBA_AW_SEARCH_PATH="$AW_HOME/src/samples/simple;$AW_HOME/src/aribaweb;..."

      (Assuming you've set an AW_HOME variable to point at the root directory of your
       AribaWeb installation)
