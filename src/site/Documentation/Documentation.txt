You can always read the source code, but documentation has its place!

Tutorials
======================
There are a few short guides to help you get started:

  - **[Getting Started](Getting_Started.txt)** explains installation
    and the structure of the distribution.

  - **[Creating a New App](Creating_New_App.txt)** details the small number of steps
    required to create a new app and get it running.

  - **[Setting up IDE Integration](IDE_Plugins.txt)** describes how to configure your Eclipse or
    IntelliJ IDEA IDEA for optimal AW development productivity.


API Documentation
=================
Check out the **[API Documentation](http://aribaweb.org/api/index.html)**.
AW Supports "enriched JavaDoc" for all UI components: in addition the the Java-level API
documentation, most UI components detail their bindings, named content areas, etc.

Examples and Screencasts
========================
The best way to learn AW is to:

  1. Watch the screencasts  (there are loads of them, and many go into great detail)
  2. Check out the included examples

The "Demo" app (which you can start simply by clicking on bin/start in the AW distribution)
contains many examples.  Make sure to turn on *Component Inspector* as you click through --
then you can "X-ray" in on the code behind what you're seeing.
