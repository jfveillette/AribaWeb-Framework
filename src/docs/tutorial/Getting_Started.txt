Getting Started With AribaWeb
=============================

(AribaWeb README file, November 2008)

Introduction
------------

AribaWeb is a component-oriented framework for building web application
user interfaces.  The AW distribution includes both the (relatively) low-level
core rendering and request handling framework (ariba.aribaweb) as well
as a higher level library of ui components (ariba.widgets, ariba.metaui, ...)


Intended Audience
-----------------

Presently documentation and tutorials are limited.  This situation will be
remedied soon.  Until then, if you don't already know how to use AribaWeb,
you may get discouraged if you don't have access to an experienced AW user.

Version 5.0b6 (BETA)
--------------------

Although most of the libraries in this distribution has been incorporated in a
variety of Ariba commercial application releases over as many as 9 years, this
is its first release in OpenSource form and there are, therefore, likely issues
that will arise from its use in non-Ariba contexts.  Also, the documentation
is not ready for release and the metaui (and especially metaui-jpa) layers
are new.  As such, we're calling it beta for the time being...  (That said, the
majority of aribaweb and widgets APIs are likely to be very stable from here foreward)

Running Examples
----------------

  0  See online video tutorial: [Getting Started](http://www.vimeo.com/1790856)

  1. Install the Java5 or Java6 JDK (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)
        > set your JAVA_HOME I.e.:
	        `export JAVA_HOME="d:/jdk1.5"`

  2. **Double-click in `aribaweb/bin` directory on `start`**

  3. Wait a minute or so and the Demo will open automatically in your browser
		(your browser should open to http://localhost:9080/Demo/AribaWeb)

  4.  See src/BUILD.txt for more instructions on building and debugging

Building your Own App
---------------------

Getting started with a new application is easy!  See [Creating_New_App](Creating_New_App.html).

Shipped Directories
-------------------

 - **lib/**
        The aribaweb jars, plus, in ext-*, third-party libraries for runtime, build time, and demo

 - **src/**
        Source code for the AribaWeb jars

 - **examples/**
        A few examples of using AribaWeb

 - **tools/**
        Files used by the AW (Ant-based) build system, plus bundled copies of Ant (1.7.1) and Tomcat (6.0.x)

 - **bin/**
        Shell scripts and groovy scripts, including the `start` and `aw` scripts,
        there to get you going quickly.

 - **ide/**
        Contains the aribawebIdeaPlugin.jar, ariba.ideplugin.eclipse.5.0b6.jar -- a plug ins
        for two popular Java IDEs 

Generated Directories
---------------------

 - **build/**
        derived source, compilied .class files, and computed app-local catalina-base directories
 - **webapps/**
        WAR files for AW sample/demo applications (fully self-contained, with jars and resources)
 - **conf/**
       A copy of the CATALINA_HOME (Tomcat) conf directory.  Putting a copy
       here allows tomcat to run directly on this install (without moving files
       into your default CATALINA_HOME/BASE)
                
Lib Details:
------------

 - ariba.util.jar
    > Low-level utility classes used by the other AW components.  Includes logging,
    collection wrappers, performance metric and debugging tracing utilities, as well
    as "ClassExtension" and "FieldValue" support for AOP-like external class
    extension, and JavaBeans-like high-performance property access.

 - ariba.aribaweb.jar
    > The core AribaWeb framework.  Includes servlet adaptors to bind AW into a
    container, the AWComponent and AWElement hierarchy, template parser, and
    built-in tags for control flow (AWIf, AWFor, etc) as well as HTML constructs
    (AWTextField, AWPopup, ...) as well at the client-side javascript libraries
    to deliver an AJAX user experience (incremental refresh, drag/drop, ...)

    > Note: this jar contains webserver resources in docroot/** that need to be
    copied to any application deployment WAR file.

 - ariba.widgets.jar
    > Higher level UI components for building AribaWeb applications.  Includes:
    - Layout components (*PageWrapper, TabSet, SectionHead/Body, PortletWrapper)
    - Controls (PopupMenu, Chooser, Calendar)
    - Rich DataTable, PivotTable and Tree/Outline support
    - Validation display / navigation UI (ErrorFlag, ...)
    - Wizard framework (multi-step UIs)
    > Several of these controls provide a rich user interface via associated client-side
    JavaScript libraries (e.g. type-ahead choosers, scrolling and dynamic data retrieval
    in tables).

    > Note: this jar contains webserver resources in docroot/** that need to be
    copied to any application deployment WAR file.

 - ariba.expr.jar
    > A simple expression parser/interpreter that can be used in AW tag bindings
    and metaui property definitions.  Based originally on OGNL code, but with a
    more Java/Groovy-inspired syntax and using ariba.util.fieldvalue for high-performance
    property access.  (Also supports interfaces for type-safe validation of
    restricted subsets of APIs exposed for business application end-user scripting)

 - ariba.metaui.jar                    [Beta]
    > Meta-data driven UI framework, built on the full AribaWeb stack for generating
    complete user interfaces "on the fly" based on various sources of meta data
    (java class introspection, annotations, and ".oss" files).  Uses CSS-like
    "multi-dimensional selectors" to contextually specify properties.
    Currently supports generating forms (with validation), tables, as well as
    global application navigation (e.g. nav tabs) and Action (global and instance-level)

 - ariba.groovyloader
    > Integration between AribaWeb and the Groovy scripting language.  Supports
      rapid-turnaround on edits to .groovy source files, and the embedding of
      groovy source code in .awl files via the `groovy` tag.

Src/ Details
------------

 - BUILD.txt
      > Read this for instructions on how to build the AribaWeb distribution from source

 - util, aribaweb, widgets, expr, metaui, groovyloader/
      > Correspond to the above-described jars

 - build.xml
      > Ant build files.  Each source sub-directory has a build.xml file that references
        shared build rules in the build-support directory


 - examples/
     > Contains a few simple AW sample applications:
      - GuestBook/ A single-component "Guest Book" mini app (see Main.{awl, java})
      - Demo/ A demo application that includes:
       - the "SearchSource" documentation / source code search a browse mini-app
       - selected "widget gallery" examples (DataTables, PivotTables, ...)
       - MetaUI forms example
       - Master detail mini app (with panels, etc)
