Feature Overview
=================

Rich Widgets
------------

In addition to core control constructs and dynamic wrappers for core HTML tags,
AribaWeb includes a full complement of higher-level widgets, from **tab sets**,
client-side **panels**, **wizards**, and **page wrappers**, to **buttons**,
**choosers**, and **menus**, all the way to scrolling, sorting
**data tables**, **tree tables**, **pivot tables**, and a **rich text editor**.

In addition, AW provides a rich validation framework that makes specifying
validation easy (and often automatic) and provides users easy navigation of any
errors on the page.

And all of this automatically get the benefits of "Auto AJAX"...


Auto AJAX
---------

Traditionally, even with the best client-side JavaScript libraries, writing AJAX
applications can be complex and error prone; developers are usually forced to deal
with two languages (Java and JavaScript) and two programming models (one server-side
one client-side).

AribaWeb changes this equation.  In AribaWeb,
*you program with a singe simple, declarative, server-side programming model*, and
**AribaWeb automatically provides AJAX behavior**.  AribaWeb provides AJAX-style
incremental page refresh through a unique mechanism called *Refresh Regions*.  Essentially,
your app processes a user action as if it were rendering a full new page in response,
and then AW figures out which parts of the response differ from the current browser
document and sends only those changes.

In addition to refresh regions, many AribaWeb widgets (Choosers, scrolling tables,
rich text editors) are JavaScript enhanced, so you get the benefits of rich AJAX
controls without ever writing (or maintaining) a line of JavaScript.

AribaWeb also comprehensively solves the **browser back button** problem!


Enterprise Proven
-----------------

AribaWeb has been **deployed to literally millions of users for nearly 10 years**.
AribaWeb is at the heart of every application in [Ariba](http://www.ariba.com)'s
Spend Management solutions and [Network services](http://discovery.ariba.com) --
market leading web application used by hundreds of the largest corporations around
the world, both deployed behind their firewalls and hosted at scale as a multi-tenant
"On Demand" service.


Minimal Code, Maximum Inference
-------------------------------

AribaWeb is designed with the principal that less is more: less boilerplate,
less configuration, less wrote coding, more functionality, more maintainability,
more fun.  AW minimizes the code required to express your applications through:

  - A *rich component model* for nested, repeated, stateful or stateless components
    that supports extensive factoring of reusable code
  - An extensive library of versatile pre-built components that means that most of what
    you need has already been written (and tested) for you
  - *Declarative binding* for input, output, and actions that means you'll never
    write code to process form values or generate a URL
  - *Inferred configuration* that means you just author your components; the configuration
    is implied
  - AW's *Meta Data Driven UI* that can derive forms, data tables, action menus, or even
    a complete application purely from your domain object model.


Integrated Inspectors
---------------------

With traditional tools, getting your arms around a large web application can be
chore.  AribaWeb substantially eases this burden with *Component Inspector*,
an integrated, in-process development tool that provides an x-ray view through
your running application.  You'll never again need hunt for the source of some
element you see in the UI.

And, whether it's a component identified in Component Inspector, or (heaven forbid)
a line number listed in an exception stack trace, with AribaWeb's *IDE Integration*
you're always just one mouse-click away from editing the file.


Rapid Turnaround
----------------

UI development is most fun when you can rapidly try out alternative ideas.
With AribaWeb, whether you're editing your component template (.awl file),
or your *Java or Groovy* source file, AW will compile and reload your changes
all without restarting your server or even losing your session (and no
IDE is required).
